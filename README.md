## Self Assessment
  The Computer Science program has been a journey that has shaped my skills and passion for technology. My ePortfolio is a collection of my projects and reflects the personal growth and learning I've experienced throughout this program. <br><br>
From the beginning, SNHU's curriculum challenged me to think critically and creatively in problem-solving. I have learned to build efficient systems and write maintainable code while improving my communication ability through comments. Projects like the Pet Boarding Check-In System allowed me to use object-oriented programming and concepts like inheritance and abstraction to create reliable modular solutions. Working on the Course Advising System in C++ pushed me to understand data structures more thoroughly, as I designed a hash table to organize and retrieve course data efficiently. However, the most rewarding project was the Event Track app, where I combined technical features of SQLite database integration and SMS notifications with a user-friendly design. I aim to get into this in the future, namely, application development or reinventions. <br><br>
Beyond the technical skills that I have learned, this program has taught me the importance of adaptability and learning as technology advances and evolves daily. I have learned to embrace the challenges, view failures as opportunities, and understand that research, even after understanding a specific skill, is key to staying on top of trends. <br><br>
As I move into my professional career post-military, I am excited to bring the two together, bringing my skills, creativity, and determination to new challenges I will face. <br><br>

### IT-145
The Pet Boarding Check-In System, developed early in my software development coursework, highlights my object-oriented programming skills, including inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction, through features like pet data management, space availability, and user interaction, while demonstrating best practices in modularity, error handling, and system reliability.

### CS-300
The Course Advising System, developed in C++ during my CS300 course, showcases my proficiency in data structures and algorithms by utilizing a hash table to manage course data efficiently and providing a user-friendly interface for accessing course details and prerequisites.

## [Databases](https://github.com/tbaessler/CS499-Capstone/tree/Databases)
### CS-360
I developed an Event Tracker app designed to manage user logins, store event data in a local SQLite database, and send SMS notifications triggered by specific events, focusing on a user-centered approach with a simple, intuitive interface for login, database management, and permission requests.
