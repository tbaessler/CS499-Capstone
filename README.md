## Software Engineering and Design
The Pet Boarding Check-In System is a software application designed to manage the check-in process for a pet boarding facility. This project demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, including inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction. 
<br><br>
Key features include:
* **Class design:** Classes for different pet types were created to manage pet data and space availability.
* **Methods implementation:** Methods were implemented to handle check-ins, manage space, and process pet data.
* **Error handling and User Interaction:** The system includes error handling and a user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth operations.
* **Best practices:** The project emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and proper testing and debugging techniques.

While completing this code, I have learned the importance of documentation and maintaining a clear project structure, which will guide me in future projects and enhancements.
