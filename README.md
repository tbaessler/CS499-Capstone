## Databases
The Event Tracker app, developed as part of CS 360, is designed to manage user logins, store event data in a local SQLite database, and send SMS notifications triggered by specific events. I focused on a user-centered design, implementing a simple and intuitive UI that supports login, database management, and permission request workflows.
<br><br>
Key features include:
* **User-friendly UI:** The app employs a LinearLayout structure for a clean, vertical stack of components, ensuring ease of use across various devices.
* **Event management:** Users can add, reset, and view events with clearly labeled EditText fields and action buttons styled for consistency and usability.
* **UI enhancements:** Proper spacing and minimum button heights ensure the interface is intuitive and accessible.
* **Core functionalities:** The app supports user input validation, event data storage, and SMS notifications, emphasizing smooth interactions and functionality.

This project showcases my ability to design and implement a functional mobile application focusing on UI/UX principles, event management, and user input handling. <br>

This artifact was a challenging yet rewarding experience, inspiring further learning and exploration in mobile app development.
