## Algorithms and Data Structures
The Course Advising System is a C++ application designed to manage and retrieve course information using a hash table. The system stores essential data, including course numbers, titles, descriptions, and prerequisites, and provides a user-friendly, menu-driven interface to view courses and their details. 
<br><br>
Key features include:
* **Efficient data management:** A hash table stores and retrieves course information efficiently, demonstrating an understanding of data structures.
* **Course and prerequisite management:** The system connects courses to their prerequisites, adding depth to their functionality.
* **Algorithmic thinking:** Sorting and display features ensure that courses are organized and easily accessible.

This project showcases my ability to design efficient solutions for structured data management and my adaptability in overcoming technical limitations. <br>

Enhancing this system provided valuable learning experiences, especially in troubleshooting file management issues, and deepened my understanding of foundational programming principles applied to more complex tasks.
